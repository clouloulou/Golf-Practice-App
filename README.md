## 🎯 **NEW: Multi-Metric Tracking**

### **GIR Challenge (140-190 yds)** - 5 Individual Tracking Buttons
When you complete this drill, you'll see **5 separate buttons** to log performance for each club:
- 📈 **Log 5 Iron** (out of 10 shots)
- 📈 **Log 6 Iron** (out of 10 shots)
- 📈 **Log 7 Iron** (out of 10 shots)
- 📈 **Log 8 Iron** (out of 10 shots)
- 📈 **Log 9 Iron** (out of 10 shots)

**How it works:**
1. Complete the drill (hit 10 shots with each club)
2. Click each button to log performance per club
3. View Progress tab to see individual charts for each club
4. Track which clubs are consistent vs. need work!

**Example Progress View:**
- 5 Iron: 7/10 GIR (70% - 🟠 Orange)
- 6 Iron: 8/10 GIR (80% - 🟢 Green)
- 7 Iron: 6/10 GIR (60% - 🔴 Red - needs work!)
- 8 Iron: 9/10 GIR (90% - 🟢 Green)
- 9 Iron: 8/10 GIR (80% - 🟢 Green)

### **Scoring Zone** - 3 Individual Tracking Buttons
When you complete this drill, you'll see **3 separate buttons** to log each distance:
- 📈 **Log 10 yds** (how many in 3-ft circle out of 10)
- 📈 **Log 20 yds** (how many in 6-ft circle out of 10)
- 📈 **Log 30 yds** (how many in 8-ft circle out of 10)

**How it works:**
1. Complete all three distances (10 chips each)
2. Click each button to log that distance separately
3. See which distances you're strong at vs. need practice
4. Track improvement over time for each distance!

**Example Progress View:**
- 10 yds: 9/10 within 3-ft (90% - 🟢 Green)
- 20 yds: 7/10 within 6-ft (70% - 🟠 Orange)
- 30 yds: 6/10 within 8-ft (60% - 🔴 Red - needs work!)

## 🎯 **Why Individual Tracking Matters**

### **For GIR Challenge:**
Instead of seeing: "Average GIR: 70%"

You'll see:
- **5 Iron: 60%** - 🔴 Weak club, needs focus
- **6 Iron: 70%** - 🟠 Decent, room for improvement
- **7 Iron: 80%** - 🟢 Strong!
- **8 Iron: 75%** - 🟢 Good
- **9 Iron: 65%** - 🟠 Needs work

**Now you know:** Focus your practice on 5-iron and 9-iron!

### **For Scoring Zone:**
Instead of: "Average proximity: OK"

You'll see:
- **10 yards: 90%** - 🟢 Dialed in!
- **20 yards: 70%** - 🟠 Decent
- **30 yards: 50%** - 🔴 This is your weakness

**Now you know:** Spend extra time from 30 yards!

## 📈 **How to Use Multi-Metric Tracking**

### **During Practice:**
1. Complete the **GIR Challenge** drill
2. You'll see **5 buttons** at the bottom of the drill card:
   ```
   📈 Log 5 Iron  📈 Log 6 Iron  📈 Log 7 Iron  📈 Log 8 Iron  📈 Log 9 Iron
   ```
3. Click **📈 Log 5 Iron** → Enter "7" (if you hit 7/10 greens)
4. Repeat for each club
5. View **Progress tab** to see 5 separate pie charts!

### **In Progress Tab:**
You'll see **individual pie charts** for each metric:
- GIR Challenge - 5 Iron (your avg vs 60% benchmark)
- GIR Challenge - 6 Iron (your avg vs 60% benchmark)
- GIR Challenge - 7 Iron (your avg vs 60% benchmark)
- GIR Challenge - 8 Iron (your avg vs 60% benchmark)
- GIR Challenge - 9 Iron (your avg vs 60% benchmark)

Same for Scoring Zone - three separate charts for 10, 20, and 30 yards!

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **Identify Weaknesses Faster**
With individual tracking, you can quickly see:
- "I'm great with 7-iron but struggle with 5-iron"
- "I'm deadly accurate from 10 yards but inconsistent from 30"
- "My putting from 5 feet needs work"

### **Targeted Practice**
Focus your next session on your weakest metrics:
- If 5-iron GIR is 50% → Extra practice with 5-iron
- If 30-yard scoring zone is 60% → Dedicate a session to 30-yard chips
- If 8-foot putts are 30% → Work on mid-range putting

### **Track Improvement Over Time**
Log performance after every session to see:
- "My 6-iron GIR improved from 60% to 80% this month!"
- "30-yard proximity jumped from 50% to 75%"
- "3-4 foot putting consistency is now 90%+"
